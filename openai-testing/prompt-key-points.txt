PROMPT:

A neutron star is the collapsed core of a massive supergiant star, which had a total mass of between 10 and 25 solar masses, possibly more if the star was especially metal-rich.[1] Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stellar objects, excluding black holes and hypothetical white holes, quark stars, and strange stars.[2] Neutron stars have a radius on the order of 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) and a mass of about 1.4 solar masses.[3] They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei.

What are some key points?
1.

RESPONSE:

1. Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars.
2. They result from a supernova explosion.
3. They have a radius of about 10 kilometres and a mass of about 1.4 solar masses.
