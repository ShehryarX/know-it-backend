PROMPT:

A neutron star is the collapsed core of a massive supergiant star, which had a total mass of between 10 and 25 solar masses, possibly more if the star was especially metal-rich.[1] Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stellar objects, excluding black holes and hypothetical white holes, quark stars, and strange stars.[2] Neutron stars have a radius on the order of 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) and a mass of about 1.4 solar masses.[3] They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei.

tl;dr:

RESPONSE:
A star that is 10 to 25 times the mass of the Sun collapses into a neutron star.

The radius of a neutron star is about 10 km, which is about the size of a city.

A neutron star is so dense that a teaspoonful of neutron star material weighs about a
